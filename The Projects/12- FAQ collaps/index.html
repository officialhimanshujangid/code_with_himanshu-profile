                Higher salary bracket (usually freshers start their career with 4 LPA and experienced candidates receive

            </h3>

                expect growth. This profession is not going obsolete anytime soon. Web development is expected to grow
                to double the percentage of the average of all other occupations. Businesses are nowadays shifting
                towards increasing their presence on the internet. As the website is the face of the business in the
                internet space, many businesses are creating their own website.
